  "one_liner": "Scans your project's dependencies and flags zombie packages \u2014 abandoned, outdated, or imported-but-unused \u2014 before they become a security or maintenance nightmare.",
  "problem": "Developers inherit or maintain projects with dozens of dependencies and have no quick way to audit their health. `pip audit` and `npm audit` only flag CVEs \u2014 they don't tell you a package hasn't been touched in 3 years, has a major version jump waiting, or is listed in requirements.txt but never actually imported in your code.",
  "solution": "A Python CLI that reads requirements.txt / pyproject.toml / package.json, hits the free PyPI and npm registry JSON APIs, and produces a color-coded terminal table: last release date, latest vs pinned version, days since last update, and an \"actively imported?\" check via AST scan. No auth, no setup \u2014 just `stale-deps check` in any project root.",
